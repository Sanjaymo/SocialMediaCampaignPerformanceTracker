    SUM(Marketing[Social_Media]) + 
    SUM(Marketing[Influencer_Marketing]) + 
    SUM(Marketing[Affiliate_Marketing])

// Total Products Sold
Total Products Sold = SUM(Marketing[Product_Sold])

// Cost per Product (Key Efficiency Metric)
Cost per Product = 
    DIVIDE(
        [Total Marketing Spend],
        [Total Products Sold],
        0
    )

// Google Ads Percentage
Google Ads % =

        0
    )

// Channel-Specific ROI
Channel ROI = 
    DIVIDE(
        [Total Products Sold] * [Average Product Price],
        [Total Marketing Spend],
        0
    ) - 1

// Marketing Efficiency Score
Marketing Efficiency =

        0
    )
```
